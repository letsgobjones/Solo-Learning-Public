# Privacy Policy for Solo Learning

**Last Updated:** February 4, 2025

**Introduction**

Thank you for using Solo Learning! This policy explains how Brandon Jones ("we," "us"), collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile app (the "Application").

**Information We Collect**

We collect:

*   **Automatically Collected Information:** IP address, app usage data (pages visited, time spent), operating system.
*   **Local Storage (Device-Based):** App settings (theme, timer, hero customization), learning progress.
*   **User-Provided Information:** If you contact us for support, we collect your email and support-related info.

**We do *not* collect precise location data.**

**How We Use Your Information**

We use your information to:

*   Provide and improve the Application.
*   Personalize your experience.
*   Analyze app usage (aggregated and anonymized).
*   Respond to support requests.
*   Potentially, contact you with important notices or promotions (with opt-out option).

**Third-Party Access**

*   We may share *anonymized, aggregated* data with analytics providers.
*   We may disclose information if required by law, to protect rights/safety, or with trusted service providers who agree to protect it.

**Opt-Out Rights**

Uninstall the app to stop all data collection.

**Data Retention**

We retain support email data as long as needed. Contact us at eons.crustal_2o@icloud.com to delete your support-related data.

Local data will be retained as long as the application remains installed on the device.

**Children's Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. You must be the minimum age of consent, as defined by your nation's laws, to submit personal information through the application.

**Security**

We take reasonable steps to protect your data, but no method is 100% secure.
Because Solo Learning uses @AppStorage and UserDefaults on your device, we encourage to keep your device safe from any harm as we can not be held liable for breaches in the systems.

**Changes**

We may update this policy. Continued use means you accept the changes.

**Your Consent**

By using the Application, you consent to this policy.

**Contact Us**
